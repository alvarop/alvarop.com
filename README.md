Nothing to see here... unless you want to see how I make my website!

### Setup
Run: 

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### Development

Run inside vagrant:

```bash
/vagrant/scripts/serve.sh
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:4000 on the host machine to see the site.

### Release
Run inside vagrant:

```bash
/vagrant/scripts/upload.sh
```

(You will need my password for this unfortunately...)
