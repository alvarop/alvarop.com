Nothing to see here... unless you want to see how I make my website!

### Setup
Run: 
```vagrant up```
```vagrant ssh```

### Development

Run inside vagrant:
```/vagrant/scripts/serve.sh```

Now you can go to http://localhost:4000 on the host machine to see the site.

### Release
Run inside vagrant:
```/vagrant/scripts/upload.sh```
(You will need my password for this unfortunately...)
