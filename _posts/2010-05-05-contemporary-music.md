So today I had my first encounter with contemporary (1900-now) music. It was pretty cool. I have never heard music like that, it was just piano, violin, and one song with a cello. Here's a picture from my walk back to the car:

            url="/images/blgr/IMG_0659.JPG" %}

In other news, my sinus infection is back... I hope these antibiotics do their job quickly.
