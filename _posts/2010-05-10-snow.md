I  woke up this morning to see my car covered with some snow, along with  most houses around the area. This is not usual for May 9th. Here's a  picture while it was still snowing.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/blgr/s400/IMG_1120.JPG"
            title=""
            caption=""
            url="/images/blgr/IMG_1120.JPG" %}

Ok, so it's a picture of a fence... You can see some snow around the stop sign though!
