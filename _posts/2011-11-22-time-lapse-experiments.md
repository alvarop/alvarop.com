I recently started experimenting some more with time-lapse videos while moving. I bought a suction cup mount for my DSLR and tested it out in my car.

{% include image.html
            img="/images/blgr/s400/camera_on_window.jpg"
            title="Testing mount on my window!"
            caption="Testing mount on my window!"
            url="/images/blgr/camera_on_window.jpg" %}

Here's a very rough test of the car setup. I just wanted to see if the mount stuck to the window and didn't fall with the rough Houston roads.

I also tested it on a quick flight around the area. Since it was a bit gusty, the video shakes a lot. I tried out youtube's built-in stabilization feature and it seemed to do a good job!

You can see the original, much shakier one, here:
