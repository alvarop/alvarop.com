One partof the lake.

There are tons of lakes in Finland. Lake Suolijärvi is nearest to where I live. Several international students decided to have a BBQ by the lake and go swimming, so we headed over around 9pm. I don’t remember if I went swimming that time, but we go there a lot. The first time I was there was with some coworkers.</p>

Not sure what they were doing with the grill here...

People brought their own charcoal grills along with some one-time use grills (which I had never seen before.)

There was one group of students from Mexico.
