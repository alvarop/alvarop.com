So I skipped a few days. I'll get the hang of this eventually...

So today I "helped" the Students Innovating Technology group with a new hydroponics system. I say "helped" because I mostly just took pictures and documented the build. I did carry stuff around at one point, but I can't take credit for the work.

The way this works is with a water reservoir at the bottom with a pump. The water (with nutrients) flows to the top pipe, where plans will be, and down to the next step. When the pump is flowing, the water level rises until it overflows through the larger pipes in the end of the tube. There is a much smaller pipe near the bottom of each tube that helps empty out each level once the pump turns off. 

The plans that will be growing are the type that clean the air and produce oxygen at night.
