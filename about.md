Hi! My name is Alvaro. I'm an Electrical Engineer living in Sunnyvale, CA. My main interests include electronics, [watching movies][1], flying, photography(time-lapse and high-speed), and traveling. If you're interested, you can find my [resume here][9].

### Stuff I make

I make silly videos about my projects and other things. You can watch them on [my youtube channel][2].
 
I also occasionally upload some travel or event photos to my [Flickr account][3].

While photos and videos are in other sites, this one contains my blog. You can read about some of [my travels][4], about [my projects][5], and [other stuff][6].

### Other stuff

I was a guest on the [Embedded.fm][7] podcast.

Here's my talk at the Hackaday Superconference in 2015:

There's also a Hackaday article about some of my [ProtoX reverse engineering work][8].

I gave a talk for students in the [Design_Code_Build][10] program at the [Computer History Museum][11]:
